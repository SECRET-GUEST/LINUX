# LINUX
Noob tutorial for some linux distributions ( Debian, Kali, Centos, Gentoo, Arch / black,..)

## Introduction

Welcome to this collection of tutorials dedicated to the different Linux distributions I use. The goal of these tutorials is not to be exhaustive, but rather to serve as practical examples for the people close to me. However, these resources are open to any contribution, and I would be particularly grateful for any help provided in translation.

Each branch of this repository represents a specific distribution, making it easier to download the necessary documentation as per your needs.

It is conceivable that this repository will evolve over time, with the addition of sections dedicated to installing Docker solutions for each distribution, or configurations for the cloud and other relevant technologies.

Your contribution to this initiative is welcome, be it by sharing your expertise, proposing improvements, or participating in the translation of the contents. Together, we can enrich these resources and facilitate the learning and use of Linux for our community.

Feel free to explore the different branches of this repository, and to download the documentation that meets your needs.
